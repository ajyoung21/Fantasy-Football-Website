# Fantasy-Football-Website
A standings page for my Fantasy Football league.


In this repo, I us ESPN.py to scrape data from my Fantasy Football league to present on index.html. 

This website was created without Bootstrap/CSS, so the styling isn't up to what I would want it to be. Also, all of the GIFs require a lot of server energy.
